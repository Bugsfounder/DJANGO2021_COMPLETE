# Django Installation & Getting Started | Python Django

### Steps For Installing Django:

Let's work on installing Django from scratch.

Django is a rapid development framework with a great community working on making it better and better with time, but at the end of the day, it is just a python package, and we can conveniently install python packages with the help of pip. Let's install Django by following the steps below:

#### Step 1: Open Windows Powershell or any other terminal on your computer.

#### Step 2: Enter the command below and press enter:

```
pip install django
```

> **_ NOTE _**
> Multiple versions of Python may be installed on your pc.
> If you are a beginner and don't have any prior experience working with multiple Python versions, I would suggest removing all the Python versions and then installing the latest Python version.

## Verifying The Installation Of Django

Now, we will check whether Django is correctly installed or not.
Open Windows Powershell or terminal and fire the command below:

```
python -m django --version
```

## Pycharm IDE or Visual Studio Code:

##### VS CODE

Letâ€™s start the installation process. First, we are going to see the installation of VS Code. For that search "VS Code download" on google or directly visit the URL:

##### PYCHARM IDE

Download the community edition of Pycharm IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows.
It is open-source and totally free to use IDE. You can purchase the professional edition, which has special support for Django,
but I recommend using the free community edition if you are a beginner.
